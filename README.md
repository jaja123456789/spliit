## Run locally

1. Clone the repository (or fork it if you intend to contribute)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start a PostgreSQL server with `./scripts/start-local-db.sh`.
4. Copy the file `.env.example` as `.env`
5. Run prisma migrations and generate the client with `npm run prisma-migrate` and `npm run prisma-generate`
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Run in a container

1. Run `npm run build-image` to build the docker image from the Dockerfile
2. Copy the file `container.env.example` as `container.env`
3. Run `npm run start-container` to start the postgres and the spliit2 containers
4. You can access the app by browsing to http://localhost:3000

## Health check

The application has a health check endpoint that can be used to check if the application is running and if the database is accessible.

- `GET /api/health/readiness` or `GET /api/health` - Check if the application is ready to serve requests, including database connectivity.
- `GET /api/health/liveness` - Check if the application is running, but not necessarily ready to serve requests.

## Opt-in features

### Expense documents

Spliit offers users to upload images (to an AWS S3 bucket) and attach them to expenses. To enable this feature:

- Follow the instructions in the _S3 bucket_ and _IAM user_ sections of [next-s3-upload](https://next-s3-upload.codingvalue.com/setup#s3-bucket) to create and set up an S3 bucket where images will be stored.
- Update your environments variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPENSE_DOCUMENTS=true
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
```

You can also use other S3 providers by providing a custom endpoint:

```.env
S3_UPLOAD_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

### Create expense from receipt

You can offer users to create expense by uploading a receipt. This feature relies on [OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) and a public S3 storage endpoint.

To enable the feature:

- You must enable expense documents feature as well (see section above). That might change in the future, but for now we need to store images to make receipt scanning work.
- Subscribe to OpenAI API and get access to GPT 4 with Vision (you might need to buy credits in advance).
- Update your environment variables with appropriate values:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECEIPT_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Deduce category from title

You can offer users to automatically deduce the expense category from the title. Since this feature relies on a OpenAI subscription, follow the signup instructions above and configure the following environment variables:

```.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CATEGORY_EXTRACT=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Group cloud sync

Spliit allows users to sync their groups to the cloud and access them across multiple devices. This feature uses magic link authentication via email.

#### How it works

1. Users can opt-in to sync a group by providing their email address (upcoming oauth provide support)
2. A magic link is sent to their email for authentication
3. Once verified, the group is synced with their sync profile
4. They can access all their synced groups from any device by signing in with their sync profile
5. Users control sync preferences (sync can be enabled/disabled at any time for each group)

#### SMTP setup

To enable group sync, configure an SMTP server for sending magic link emails:

```.env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<run: openssl rand -base64 32>
```

**Popular SMTP providers:**

- **Smtp2go**: Use `mail.smtp2go.com:2525` with your SMTP2GO credentials. Generous free tier.
- **Gmail**: Use `smtp.gmail.com:587` with an [app-specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
- **SendGrid**: Use `smtp.sendgrid.net:587` with your API key as password
- **Mailgun**: Use `smtp.mailgun.org:587` with your Mailgun credentials

#### Local development

When `SMTP_HOST` is not configured, Spliit writes emails to the `.mail/` directory instead of sending them. Check this folder for magic link emails during development.

#### Sync behavior

- Groups are stored locally by default (no account required)
- Users can enable sync for individual groups at any time
- Synced groups appear in "My groups" when signed in
- Local groups remain accessible even when signed out
- Disabling sync does not delete the group, only removes cloud association
